# Overview

This is a Simulation of randomly generated creatures with randomly generated traits that evolve o reproduce if they match the standards of the given environment.

I wrote this with the intent of learning the basics of Unreal Engine as well as to better visualize the neural network and structure I created for it.

# Future Work

* Add food/hunger to entitys
* Add reproduction cycles instead of an instantaneous generation
* Create a more open environment and create different resources/biomes
* Add genders to push evolution and genomes
* Create different sizes and colors (maybe even different functional parts that can be developed)
* Create a method for creatures to be eaten
* Create a better player character and player character movements
